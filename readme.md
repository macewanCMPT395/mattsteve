Installing
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
To begin, first download [Composer][1] globally. This is the dependency manager for php. If using a Unix machine, this can be done by running 'curl -sS https://getcomposer.org/installer | php'  in the terminal. Once it is installed, move it into your bin directory by running "mv composer.phar /usr/local/bin/composer" in the terminal. 

The next step is to clone or fork this repository to your local machine. All components of laravel are included within this repository along with the files necessary to run the "Introduction To Software Engineering Facebook" app. There are many github tutorials that will show you how to clone or fork a repository. Please consult one if you require more information. Among the files in this repository is an editable sqlite database.

Lastly to begin using the app, go into the cloned directory of this repository on your local machine by running the command "cd mattsteve/", then run the command "php artisan serve". This will boot up a server that can be accessed at http://localhost:8000. Enter that url into the browser and you will be brought to the Introduction To Software Engineering Facebook home page.

Laravel is a web application framework with expressive, elegant syntax. We believe development must be an enjoyable, creative experience to be truly fulfilling. Laravel attempts to take the pain out of development by easing common tasks used in the majority of web projects, such as authentication, routing, sessions, and caching.

Laravel aims to make the development process a pleasing one for the developer without sacrificing application functionality. Happy developers make the best code. To this end, we've attempted to combine the very best of what we have seen in other web frameworks, including frameworks implemented in other languages, such as Ruby on Rails, ASP.NET MVC, and Sinatra.

Laravel is accessible, yet powerful, providing powerful tools needed for large, robust applications. A superb inversion of control container, expressive migration system, and tightly integrated unit testing support give you the tools you need to build any application with which you are tasked.

## Official Documentation

Documentation for the entire framework can be found on the [Laravel website](http://laravel.com/docs).
